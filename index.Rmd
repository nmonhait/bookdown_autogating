# What's inside?

The goal of this tutorial is to take manually gated data from a .wsp flowJo file and use the Bioconductor `openCyto` framework to create an automated gating procedure within R which can be replicated on any dataset. The basic functions used in this tutorial include:  

*openWorkspace()  
*parseWorkspace()  
*gatingTemplate()  
*gating()  
*plot()  
*plotGate()    

The example data used in this tutorial is from Colorado State University's Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology Department. Alternatively, you can input your own flowJo Workspace and follow this tutorial, so long as the file is in .wsp format. 

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
