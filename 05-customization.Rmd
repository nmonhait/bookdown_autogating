# Customization

It is possible that additional customization may be necessary when working with the `openCyto` framework. Below are three common customizations that will be outlined in this chapter. 

1. Hiding unwanted nodes
2. Renaming nodes 
3. Adjusting plots     

## Hiding unwanted nodes 

When automating analysis, there may be nodes that were not predefined in the .csv gating template or nodes that may not be of interest in your particular analysis. Plotting the gating hierarchy using the `plot()` function will display this and then nodes can be hidden based on need with the following code. Below is an example of a "full" gating hierarchy and then the same hierarchy with the CD3+ node removed. 

**Full Hierarchy**  

```{r full nodes, eval=FALSE}
plot(gh)
```

**CD3+ Removed Hierarchy**  

To remove nodes, first save the unwanted nodes as an R object named **nodesToHide**. Next, use the code following the `lapply()` function, only replacing **gs** with your GatingSet object name.  

```{r hide cd3+, eval=FALSE}
nodesToHide <- "CD3+"
lapply(nodesToHide, function(thisNode)setNode(gs, thisNode, FALSE))
```

## Renaming nodes

Rename nodes based on your preferences with the following code. Within the `setNode` function, the first input is the current cell population name and the second is the desired change.  

```{r rename node, eval=FALSE}
setNode("Live", "Viable")
```
 
## Adjusting plots

### Adjust plot axes  

As seen in chapter 2, it may be necessary to adjust the plot axes in order to best view the gates. This is done using the code below. Setting xlim and ylim to "data" adjusts plot based on the actual data range, rather than instrument specifications. Custom ranges can also be input numerically. 

```{r adjust axes, eval=FALSE}
flowWorkspace.par.set("plotGate", list(xlim = "data",
                                       ylim = "data"))
```

Here is a comparison of xlim and ylim set as "instrument" and then "data".  

**Instrument** 

```{r instrument, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/monhait/Desktop/bookdown_autogating/images/CD8_instrument.png")
```

**Data**  

```{r data, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/monhait/Desktop/bookdown_autogating/images/cd8_data.png")
```

### Transform data for better visualization  

Although data will not be altered in any way, transformation may allow for better visualization. The most common form of transformation for flow cytometry analysis is [bioexponential](http://docs.flowjo.com/vx/graphs-and-gating/gw-transform-overview/). Below is a comparison of gates without transformation and gates that have been transformed.  

**Without Transformation**  

```{r no trans, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/monhait/Desktop/bookdown_autogating/images/no_trans.png")
```

**Transformed**  

```{r trans, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/monhait/Desktop/bookdown_autogating/images/trans.png")
```
