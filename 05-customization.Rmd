# Plot Customization

Below are two common customizations that you may want to include when plotting gates.  

1. Adjust plot axes  
2. Binning in a plot   

## Adjusting plots

### Adjust plot axes  

As seen in Chapter 2, it may be necessary to adjust the plot axes in order to best view the gates. This is done using the code below. Setting xlim and ylim to "data" adjusts plot based on the actual data range, rather than instrument specifications. Custom ranges can also be input numerically. 

```{r adjust_axes, eval=FALSE}
flowWorkspace.par.set("plotGate", list(xlim = "data",
                                       ylim = "data"))
```

Here is a comparison of xlim and ylim set as "instrument" and then "data".  

**Instrument** 

```{r instrument, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/monhait/Desktop/bookdown_autogating/images/CD8_instrument.png")
```

**Data**  

```{r data, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/monhait/Desktop/bookdown_autogating/images/cd8_data.png")
```

### Binning  

Adjusting the bins changes will alter the resolution of each plot. The default is `xbin = 32`. Below 

**Default Binning**
```{r no_bin, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plotGate(gh)
```

**Greater Resolution**  
```{r bin_128, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plotGate(gh, xbin = 128)
```
